# SMap

![Build](https://github.com/dadhi/SMap/actions/workflows/scala.yml/badge.svg)

Fast persistent immutable Map data-structure for Scala with minimal memory footprint.  

The SMap is based on the ImMap from my .NET C# library https://github.com/dadhi/ImTools  

Btw, **S** in Map is for **Super**.

TBD:

- [ ] Porting the minimal ImHashMap to SMap enough to test addition and lookup and benchmark with *scalameter*.
- [ ] Create and distribute the package (learn in the process).
